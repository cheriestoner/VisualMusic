# Visualize of musical expression of emotions

The degree project is investigating connections between auditory and visual aspects in emotional expression of music. It aims to explore novel ways to communicate emotions in singing, and provide helpful feedback on expressing emotions with singing using computer graphics. 

The program consists of a Unity 3D project (standalone) and a Pure Data patch communicating using the OSC protocol. The PD patch tracks your singing voice and sends parameters to the Unity standalone for generating the visualization. 

A video example of the singing visualization can be found here:
